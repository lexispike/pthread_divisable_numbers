Q2.cpp


The program creates 4 threads and 4 semaphores. Each thread checks numbers 1 - 1000 and prints out each one divisible by 3 or 4. The threads use semaphores to control the output of the number. It will print thread 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then repeat. Then, it increases a count value that then prints at the end and describes how many values were divisible by 3 or 4 overall. The value printed is 500.
